## DASH `-`
In **Linux/Unix**, the **dash** `-` is reserved to mean ‚Äú**an option**‚Äù when passed to commands.
so
: 
```bash
  command --
```
Many commands accept `--` to **stop parsing options**.

- But in our case `cat` command not stoping parsing while using command `cat -- -`
**Solution to Solve**
- Using absolute path
: 
```bash
  cat /full/path/to/-
```

## Hidden Files & Folders

### How to Create Hidden File/Folder
We need to place `.` in front of file name. <br>
ex: .hide, .file.txt, .hiddenfolder

Creating a File By Using command line Editor `nano`
: 
```bash
  nano .filename
```
prees `ctrl+s` for save and press `ctrl+x` for exit editor

Creating a Directory By using `mkdir` command
: 
```bash
  mkdir .hiddendirectory
```

### How To Find Hidden Files/Folders
```bash
  ls -a
```
- show all files and folders in working directory including hidden files/folders


### How to read Hidden Files
We can read Directly Name
```bash
cat .hiddenfile
```

- Also use simply way `cd` to go hidden folder. 

## Symbolic Link or Symlink
A file that stores the path to another file.

```bash
ln -s /var/log/syslog mylog
```
- `mylog` ‚Üí symbolic link
- points to ‚Üí `/var/log/syslog`

- Viewing Symlinks
: 
```bash
ls -l
```
output:
```bash
lrwxrwxrwx 1 user user     11 Aug 27 21:00 mylog -> /var/log/syslog
```

- check symlink itself and symlink real file File Type
: 
```bash
file mylog
```
```bash
file -L mylog
```


## File descriptors (stdin, stdout, stderr) & `2>/dev/null`

In Linux, every process has file descriptors: 
- 0 ‚Üí Standard Input (stdin)
- 1 ‚Üí Standard Output (stdout)
- 2 ‚Üí Standard Error (stderr)

So when you **run a command**:
- Normal output goes to **stdout** (1)
- Errors go to **stderr** (2)

‚úÖ What `2>/dev/null` does: 
- `2>` ‚Üí **Redirect stderr** (error messages)
- `/dev/null` ‚Üí **A special file that discards all data written to it** (like a ‚Äú**black hole**‚Äù)
```bash
command 2>/dev/null
```
- Runs the command, but **hides all error messages**.Normal output (`stdout`) still appears.

**Useful Cases**
: 

1. Suppress unwanted errors (e.g., permission denied, file not found)
: 
```bash
find / -name "file.txt" 2>/dev/null
```
- Finds file without showing "Permission denied" messages.

1. Separate stdout and stderr
: 
```bash
command >out.txt 2>err.txt
```
- Normal output in `out.txt`, errors in `err.txt`.

1. Discard both stdout and stderr
: 
```bash
command > /dev/null 2>&1
```
- Runs silently (no output, no errors).

## Shell Operators 

### I/O Redirection Operators (| & < << <<< > >> >>>)
üëâThese are the special shell metacharacters that control where stdin (0), stdout (1), stderr (2) go.

#### Input Redirection
: 
- `< file` ‚Üí Take input from file instead of keyboard
```bash
command < input.txt
```
- `<< WORD` (Here Document) ‚Üí Multiline input until `WORD` is seen
```bash
cat << EOF
Hello
Linux
EOF
```
- `<<< STRING` (Here String) ‚Üí Take a single string as input
```bash
wc -w <<< "Hello from Linux"
```

#### Output Redirection (stdout, FD = 1)
: 
- `> file` ‚Üí Redirect stdout to file (overwrite)
```bash
echo "Hi" > out.txt
```
- `>> file` ‚Üí Redirect stdout to file (append)
```bash
echo "Another line" >> out.txt
```
<br>

- `>>> file` (bash extension) ‚Üí Append string output to file

#### Error Redirection (stderr, FD = 2)
- `2> file` ‚Üí Redirect stderr to file (overwrite)
```bash
ls /no/dir 2> error.log
```
- `2>> file` ‚Üí Redirect stderr to file (append)

#### Redirect Both stdout + stderr
- `&> file` ‚Üí Redirect both stdout and stderr (overwrite)
- `&>> file` ‚Üí Redirect both stdout and stderr (append)
- `2>&1` ‚Üí Merge stderr into stdout (both go same place)
```bash
command > output.txt 2>&1
```

#### Piping
- `|` ‚Üí Send **stdout** of one command as **stdin** to another
```bash
ls | grep txt
```

#### File Descriptor Manipulation
- `n>&m` ‚Üí Redirect file descriptor `n` to `m`
```bash
command 2>&1     # stderr (2) goes to stdout (1)
```
- `n<&m` ‚Üí Redirect input FD
- `&-` ‚Üí Close a file descriptor
```bash
command 2>&-
```

#### & operator

- This operator allows you to **run commands** in the **background** of your terminal.

- This operator allows us to execute commands in the background. For example, let's say we want to copy a large file. This will obviously take quite a long time and will leave us unable to do anything else until the file successfully copies.

- The "&" shell operator allows us to execute a command and have it run in the background (such as this file copy) allowing us to do other things!


#### && operator

- This operator allows you to **combine multiple commands** together in one line of your terminal.

- This shell operator is a bit misleading in the sense of how familiar is to its partner "&". Unlike the "&" operator, we can use "&&" to make a list of commands to run for example `command1 && command2`. However, it's worth noting that `command2` will only run if `command1` was successful.
