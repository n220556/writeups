## How to Read File content
Reading a file depends on the environment (command line / programming language).
- Here we discuss only command line.

In Linux üêß / macOS üçé Terminal
: 

- Print file contents
: 
```bash 
cat filename.txt
```
- View file page by page
: 
```bash 
less filename.txt
```
(Press **q** to quit, arrow keys to scroll)
- Show first 10 lines
: 
```bash
head filename.txt
```
- Show last 10 lines
: 
```bash
tail filename.txt
```
- Follow file updates (like logs)
: 
```bash
tail -f filename.txt
```

In CMD
:  
```shell
type filename.txt
```

In PowerShell
: 
```powershell
Get-Content filename.txt
```

## DASH `-`

In **Linux/Unix**, the **dash** `-` is reserved to mean ‚Äú**an option**‚Äù when passed to commands.
so
: 
```bash
  command --
```
Many commands accept `--` to stop parsing options.

- But in our case `cat` command not stoping parsing while using command `cat -- -`
**Solution to Solve**
- Using absolute path
: 
```bash
  cat /full/path/to/-
```

## How To read File Which contains Spaces in their Name
we use **quotes** `""` to read file which contains spaces in their name or Navigate the Folder which contains spaces in their name
example
: 
```bash
  cat "spaces named file"
```
```bash
  cd "spaces named folder"
```
