## HexaDump

👉A **hexdump** is a representation of binary data (like the contents of a file, memory, or network packet) in a **human-readable hexadecimal format**. Since raw binary is difficult to interpret directly, tools like `hexdump` (or `xxd`, `od`) are used to display the underlying bytes in **hexadecimal values**, often alongside their ASCII equivalents if printable.

### Why use a hexdump?

- **Debugging**: To inspect binary files, memory dumps, or network packets.
- **Reverse engineering**: To analyze unknown file formats or malware.
- **Data recovery**: To view and repair raw disk sectors or corrupted files.
- **Forensics**: To investigate raw data on storage devices.

### Example of a hexdump

Suppose we have a text file **hello.txt** with the content: `Hello`
```bash
hexdump -C hello.txt
```
Output:
```bash
00000000  48 65 6c 6c 6f 0a                              |Hello.|
```

- `00000000` → offset (memory/file position in hex).
- `48 65 6c 6c 6f 0a` → raw bytes in hex.
- `Hello.` → ASCII representation (`0a` = newline, shown as `.`).




## Conversion of Text → Hexdump

### Step 1: Original Text
```text
A  B  (newline)
```
### Step 2: ASCII Codes (decimal)
```text
A = 65
B = 66
\n = 10
```
### Step 3: Binary Representation (8 bits each)
```text
A = 01000001
B = 01000010
\n = 00001010
```
### Step 4: Convert Binary → Hexadecimal
Split each 8-bit byte into 2 nibbles (4 bits):
```text
0100 0001 → 4 1 → 0x41   (A)
0100 0010 → 4 2 → 0x42   (B)
0000 1010 → 0 A → 0x0A   (newline)
```
So the bytes are:
```text
41 42 0A
```

### Step 5: Hexdump Format
Now the hexdump tool arranges this into a readable layout:
```bash
hexdump -C file.txt
```
Output:
```bash
00000000  41 42 0a                                       |AB.|
00000003
```

Breaking it Down
: 
- `00000000` → offset (we’re at the start of the file).
- `41 42 0a` → the bytes in hex.
- `|AB.|` → ASCII view (0A is newline, shown as .).
- `00000003` → total bytes processed (3 bytes).


## hexdump Tool 

1. Basic dump (hex only)
: 
```bash
hexdump file.bin
```
1. Canonical format (hex + ASCII side-by-side)
: 
```bash
hexdump -C file.bin
```
1. Limit output to specific bytes (e.g., first 32 bytes)
:
```bash
hexdump -n 32 -C file.bin
```
1. Show data in decimal, octal, hex, etc.
: 
```bash
hexdump -d file.bin   # decimal
hexdump -o file.bin   # octal
hexWhy not hexdump?

hexdump is designed as a one-way viewer.

It converts binary → hex (with ASCII help).

But it does not provide a built-in reverse option.

That’s why in practice we use xxd for both directions:

xxd file > dump.txt → create hex dump

xxd -r dump.txt > file → reverse hex dump back to binarydump -x file.bin   # hex (16-bit words)
```
1. Format with custom patterns
: 
```bash
hexdump -e '16/1 "%02x " "\n"' file.bin
```
→ prints 16 bytes per line in two-digit hex.


A **hexdump** = **binary data** → **hex** + **ASCII** view.

- ❌ The hexdump command itself *cannot* directly **reverse** a hexdump back to the original file.
✅ But there are other tools like `xxd` (and sometimes `od`) that can.

### Why not hexdump?

- `hexdump` is designed as a **one-way viewer**.
  - It converts binary → hex (with ASCII help).
  - But it does not provide a built-in **reverse** option.
- That’s why in practice we use xxd for both directions:
  - `xxd file > dump.txt` → create hex dump
  - `xxd -r dump.txt > file` → reverse hex dump back to binary

✅ So conclusion:
- `hexdump` = view only (not reversible on its own).
- `xxd` = can dump **and** reverse.
- If you insist on using `hexdump`, you need to combine it with tools like `xxd -r`.

## xxd Tool

The `xxd` command is a **hex dump** tool similar to `hexdump`, but much more flexible because:
- It can **create** hex dumps (binary → hex).
- It can **reverse** hex dumps (hex → binary).
- It supports different formats, groupings, and output styles.

It’s widely used in **debugging, reverse engineering, forensics, and data recovery**.

### Why use xxd instead of hexdump?

- `xxd` can reverse a hex dump back into the original binary (with `-r`), while `hexdump` cannot.
- Its default output format is **cleaner** (`address + hex + ASCII`).
- It supports **binary output** (with `-b`), useful for seeing raw bits.
- More flexible grouping and formatting options.

### Basic Syntax
```bash
xxd [options] [file] [outfile]
```

### Common Options

1. Default Hex Dump
: 
```bash
xxd file.bin
```
Output format:
```bash
00000000: 4865 6c6c 6f0a                           Hello.
```
- Left: offset (hexadecimal address in file).
- Middle: hex values (16 bytes per line).
- Right: ASCII representation.

1. Reverse Hex Dump → Binary
: 
```bash
xxd -r dump.txt newfile.bin
```
Takes a hex dump (from `xxd` or edited manually) and rebuilds the original binary file.

1. Limit Number of Bytes (`-l`)
: 
```bash
xxd -l 16 file.bin
```
- Dumps only the first 16 bytes.

1. Skip Bytes (`-s`)
: 
```bash
xxd -s 64 file.bin
```
- Skip the first 64 bytes before dumping.

You can also use negative values to count from the end:
```bash
xxd -s -64 file.bin  # dump starts 64 bytes before EOF
```

1. Group Bytes (`-g`)
: 
```bash
xxd -g 1 file.bin   # group by 1 byte
xxd -g 2 file.bin   # group by 2 bytes (default is 2)
xxd -g 4 file.bin   # group by 4 bytes
```
This controls how many bytes are grouped together in the hex section.

1. Binary Output (`-b`)
: 
```bash
xxd -b file.bin
```
Shows bytes in **binary form** instead of hex:
```bash
00000000: 01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00001010  Hello.
```

1. Plain Hex Dump (-p)
: 
```bash
xxd -p file.bin
```
- Prints only the hex bytes, no addresses or ASCII.
```bash
48656c6c6f0a
```
Useful for scripting, can be reversed with:
```bash
xxd -r -p hex.txt > file.bin
```

1. Width (Bytes per Line) (`-c`)
: 
```bash
xxd -c 8 file.bin
```
- Show 8 bytes per line instead of default 16.

1. Offset Base (`-o`)
: 
```bash
xxd -o 0x100 file.bin
```
- Start the offset column from `0x100` instead of `0x00`.

1. Verbose Mode (`-u`)
: 
```bash
xxd -u file.bin  # Print hex values in uppercase.
```

1. Create Patch Files (`xxd -r`)
: 
You can edit a hex dump (change bytes manually) and then reverse it:
```bash
xxd file.bin > dump.txt
# edit dump.txt in a text editor
xxd -r dump.txt file_patched.bin
```
This is used for binary patching.
