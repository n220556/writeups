## What is a Cipher?

- A **cipher** is an **algorithm** for **encrypting and decrypting messages**.
- It transforms **readable text** (plaintext) into **unreadable text (ciphertext)**, to protect confidentiality.
- To get the original message back, you need the **decryption key** and the **algorithm**.


‚ö° In short:<br>
**Cipher = method of secret writing**.

## Why are Ciphers Used?

- **Confidentiality** ‚Üí Keep information secret.
- **Authentication** ‚Üí Prove identity (digital signatures).
- **Integrity** ‚Üí Detect tampering.
- **Secure communication** ‚Üí Protect messages over insecure channels (like the internet).

## Types of Ciphers

üëâCiphers are usually divided into **Classical (old)** and **Modern (used in computers)**.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Classical Ciphers**

These were used **before computers**. They‚Äôre simple but **easy to break today**.

#### (a) Substitution Ciphers

Each letter or symbol is **replaced by another**.

1.Caesar Cipher
: 
- **Shift** each letter by a fixed number (e.g., +3).
- Example: <br>
  - Plaintext: `HELLO`
  - Ciphertext: `KHOOR` (shift by 3).
üîë Weakness: only 25 possible shifts ‚Üí trivial to brute-force.

2.ROT13
: 
- A Caesar cipher with **shift 13**.
- `A ‚Üî N`, `B ‚Üî O`, ‚Ä¶, `M ‚Üî Z`.
- Example:
  - Plaintext: `HELLO`
  - Ciphertext: `URYYB`.
üîë Applying ROT13 **twice** ‚Üí original text.

3.Monoalphabetic Cipher
: 
- Each letter maps to a unique but arbitrary letter.
- Example:
  - Key: `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ` ‚Üí `QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM`
  - Plaintext: `HELLO`
  - Ciphertext: `ITSSG`.
üîë Weakness: letter **frequency analysis** can break it.

4.Polyalphabetic Cipher (Vigen√®re Cipher)
: 
- Uses multiple Caesar shifts controlled by a keyword.
- Example: Keyword = `KEY`
  - Plaintext: `HELLO`
  - Ciphertext: `RIJVS`.

üîë More secure than Caesar, but still breakable with advanced analysis.

#### (b) Transposition Ciphers

**Rearrange characters** without changing them.

1.Rail Fence Cipher
: 
- Write text in a zigzag pattern, then read row by row.
- Example (3 rails):
  - Plaintext: `HELLO WORLD`
  - Ciphertext: `HOLEL WRLOD`.

2.Columnar Transposition
: 
- Write text in rows under a keyword, then read column by column.
- More complex rearrangement.

‚úÖ Classical ciphers ‚Üí **easy to understand but insecure today**.
They‚Äôre mainly used for teaching, puzzles, or obfuscation.


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Modern Ciphers

These are the **backbone of computer security**, **banking, internet (SSL/TLS), Wi-Fi**, etc.

#### (a) Symmetric Key Ciphers
- **Same key used** for encryption and decryption.
- Very fast.
- Must keep the key secret.
1.**Block Ciphers** (work on fixed-size blocks of data)
: 
- Example: **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**
  - Block size: 128 bits
  - Key sizes: 128, 192, 256 bits
  - Used in: HTTPS, VPNs, file encryption

2.**Stream Ciphers** (encrypt data one bit/byte at a time)
: 
- Example: **RC4** (now outdated, was used in SSL/WEP).

#### (b) Asymmetric Key Ciphers (Public Key Cryptography)

- **Uses two keys**:
  - Public key (shared openly)
  - Private key (kept secret)
- What **one key encrypts**, the **other can decrypt**.
Examples:
  - **RSA** (used for secure communication, digital signatures)
  - **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** (faster, smaller keys, used in modern SSL).
üîë Advantage: no need to share secret keys in advance.

#### (c) Hash Functions (one-way ciphers)

- **Not reversible.**
- Transform data into a fixed-size digest.
- Example: `**SHA-256**("HELLO") ‚Üí 2cf24dba...`
- Used for:
  - Password storage
  - Data integrity checks
  - Digital signatures

## ‚úÖ In summary:

- **Classical ciphers** = substitution + transposition (historical, weak).
- **Modern ciphers** = symmetric (AES, DES) + asymmetric (RSA, ECC) + hashes.
- Used for **confidentiality, integrity, authentication, secure communication**.
