## What is tr?

- `tr` stands for **translate** or **transliterate**.
- It **reads from standard input** (`stdin`), performs **character-level operations**, and **writes to standard output** (`stdout`).
- Common uses:
  - Translate characters (`a â†’ b`)
  - Delete characters
  - Squeeze (merge repeated) characters
  - Replace ranges (e.g., A-Z â†’ a-z)

It **does not work on whole words**, only **characters**.

## ðŸ”¹ Basic Syntax

```bash
tr [OPTION] SET1 [SET2]
```
- **SET1**: characters you want to work on
- **SET2**: characters you want to translate into (if applicable)

## Options and Cases

### Options

1. Translate characters
: 
- Replace characters from SET1 with SET2.
```bash
echo "hello 123" | tr 'aeiou' 'AEIOU'
```
Output:
```bash
hEllO 123
```
ðŸ‘‰ Every vowel became uppercase.

2. Delete characters (`-d`)
: 
- Remove all characters from SET1.
```bash
echo "hello 123" | tr -d '0-9'
```
Output:
```bash
hello 
```
ðŸ‘‰ Digits were deleted.

3. Squeeze repeated characters (`-s`)
: 
- Reduces **repeated consecutive characters** into a single one.
```bash
echo "hellooo    wooorld" | tr -s ' o'
```
Output:
```bash
helo world
```
ðŸ‘‰ Multiple spaces and repeated o were squeezed.

4. Complement (`-c`)
: 
- Use all characters **NOT in SET1**.
```bash
echo "hello 123" | tr -cd '0-9\n'
```
Output:
```bash
123
```
ðŸ‘‰ Deleted everything except digits.

### Character ranges
- Use ranges like `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`.
```bash
echo "HELLO" | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z'
```
Output:
```bash
hello
```
ðŸ‘‰ Uppercase â†’ lowercase.

### Character classes
- Instead of ranges, you can use predefined classes inside `[: :]`.

| Class       | Meaning                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| `[:alnum:]` | Alphanumeric (Aâ€“Z, aâ€“z, 0â€“9)  |
| `[:alpha:]` | Alphabetic characters         |
| `[:digit:]` | Digits (0â€“9)                  |
| `[:lower:]` | Lowercase letters             |
| `[:upper:]` | Uppercase letters             |
| `[:space:]` | Whitespace (space, tab, etc.) |
| `[:punct:]` | Punctuation characters        |
| `[:cntrl:]` | Control characters            |

Example:
```bash
echo "Hello 123" | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'
```
Output:
```bash
HELLO 123
```

### ROT13 Example with `tr`

```bash
echo "HELLO WORLD" | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
```
Output:
```bash
URYYB JBEYQ
```

### Examples

1. Make a file uppercase:
```bash
cat file.txt | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'
```

1. Remove blank lines:
```bash
cat file.txt | tr -s '\n'
```

1. Strip non-numeric characters:
```bash
echo "abc123!@#" | tr -cd '0-9\n'
```

1. Convert tabs to spaces:
```bash
cat file.txt | tr '\t' ' '
```

## âœ… Summary:
- `tr` = character-based translation tool.
- Key options:
  - `-d` â†’ delete
  - `-s` â†’ squeeze repeats
  - `-c` â†’ complement (not these characters)
