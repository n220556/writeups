## 🎮 Level 12 → Level 13

### 🎯 Level Goal
👉The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt**, which is a **hexdump** of a file that has been **repeatedly compressed**. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under **/tmp** in which you can work. Use `mkdir` with a hard to guess directory name. Or better, use the command “`mktemp -d`”. Then **copy** the datafile using `cp`, and **rename** it using `mv` (read the manpages!)

## 🎮 Level 13 → Level 14

### 🎯 Level Goal
👉The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on

## 🎮 Level 16 → Level 17

### 🎯 Level Goal
👉 The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL/TLS and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.
